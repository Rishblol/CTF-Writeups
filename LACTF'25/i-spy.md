Here we'd have to give tokens to each request it asked for.
* This token: B218B51749AB9E4C669E4B33122C8AE3
* A token in the HTML source code: 66E7AEBA46293C88D484CDAB0E479268
* A token in the JavaScript console: 5D1F98BCEE51588F6A7500C4DAEF8AD6
* A token in the stylesheet: 29D3065EFED4A6F82F2116DA1784C265
* A token in javascript code: 9D34859CA6FC9BB8A57DB4F444CDAE83
* A token in a header: BF1E1EAA5C8FDA6D9D0395B6EA075309
