## Question
In the realm of ancient codes, only those who enumerate correctly can unveil the hidden flag. Craft your mathematical expressions wisely and uncover the secrets that lie within.

## Solution
Here they've given a site where you have to enter an expression and it'll give and output and save it in a .txt file.

Entering an expression, we see it creates a file with some random letters.

On decoding, we see that:
`
1 = l
2 = d
3 = b
4 = h
5 = g
6 = c
7 = f
8 = e
9 = a
`

So to get flag, we have to type 7195, and we get the flag.

`flag: KCTF{_c0ngR4t5_KNIGHT_f1naLLy_Y0U_g07_tH3_r1gh7_m4tH_}`
