## Question
You know what to do.

## Solution
We've been given a website looking like this.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17326f86-1afb-47d2-ae8b-efd48e865c24)

We have to collect 7 different parts of the flag and join it to form one flag.
So the places we found the flag are:
* Source code of the home page -  `uoftctf{ju57_k33p_`
* Website headers in the networks page - `c4lm_4nd_`
* Cookies section - `1n5p3c7_`
* When writing /robots.txt - `411_7h3_`
* In styles.css - `4pp5_`
* In /hidden_admin_panel, change the cookie from guest to admin - `50urc3_`
* In /app.min.js.map - `c0d3!!}`

`flag: uoftctf{ju57_k33p_c4lm_4nd_1n5p3c7_411_7h3_4pp5_50urc3_c0d3!!}`
